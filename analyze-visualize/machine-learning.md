# Machine Learning

Bayeslab can perform simple machine learning model using a single prompt.&#x20;

It's NOT intended to produce most optimized model, but to simply provide this ability to those who doesn't understand ML nor able to use it before. (or a good way to learn)



First please see these at the **Tutorials** menu:

In each of the sample, you'll find they follow the same pattern:

1. One line to train the model

2. Another to use the trained model , using double backslash to reference the model in previous step.

{% hint style="info" %}
The model trained is short-lived and will be gone after disconnecting with machine.&#x20;



We're working to automatically preserve these models, stay tuned.
{% endhint %}



In this way, you can try any basic ML model without actually understanding it.



## Copilot Recommendation

We also provide some more guidance in Table Copilot to generate ideas which requires ML model.

Try this so you won't need to know which ML model to use for any of the business questions.
