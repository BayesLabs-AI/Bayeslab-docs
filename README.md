# ðŸ‘» Welcome to Bayeslab

Welcome to **Bayeslab**, an AI-first data workbench designed for everyoneâ€”whether you're a solo entrepreneur, a business analyst, or just someone looking to work smarter with data. Bayeslab is here to empower you to analyze, visualize, and harness the power of your data without needing a full-fledged data team.

Start here: [https://bayeslab.ai](https://bayeslab.ai)

## Why Bayeslab

Data has become the backbone of decision-making, but the tools we use havenâ€™t always kept up. For many, working with data often means wrestling with spreadsheets, jumping between tools, or waiting for data engineers to clean and prepare datasets.

_Bayeslab changes the way._



Whether youâ€™re an analyst, manager or operations, Bayeslab helps you go further, fasterâ€”without needing a Ph.D. in data science.

See the video below to get a quick start:

## Editing Experience

Bayeslab is a notebook style editor which follows [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) principles. Meaning it's:

* **Natural language based**
  * Use natural language to describe what you'd like to do, and explain the results
  * Special context reference to help AI accurately understand
  * AI will help to do what you describe,  such as run/analyze/interpret
    * For more details of how to write prompt with content reference, see [Writing Prompt](basics/prompt.md)

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Block based**
  * The notebook is organized into a sequence of blocks representing step by step exploration nature of data analysis. (If you've used [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) before, this should be almost identical)

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sample of an AI block</p></figcaption></figure>



And it's specialized for **data analysis scenarios**, meaning:

*   **Handle various kind of data natively**

    * Import [data files](connect-to-data/data-table.md#import-from-file) or connect to [external data sources](connect-to-data/external-sources.md).
    * Schema definition built-in and automatically provide to Gen-AI as context


* **Provide fine-tuned AI help across** [**entire analysis flow**](analyze-visualize/your-analysis-flow.md)
  * Including cleaning, analysis/chart ideas, result interpretation, report generation...etc
  * Latest Generative-AI model with well-designed context for data analysis
  * Smart identification of result variable for use in later editing

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently we're using a mixture of GPT-4o, O1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This will evolves in the future as base model evolves.
{% endhint %}

* **Enable self-editing at every step to get better results**
  * Full editing experience for underline python/sql/data/chart to suite your own needs
  * Unified SQL to join/process all data sources

### When to use Bayeslab?

In modern data stack(though lots of different versions),  it's **hard to see** where Bayeslab is landed exactly:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>source:<a href="https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/">https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/</a></p></figcaption></figure>

This also says for itself the **complex situation** that real data analysis scenarios resides in. &#x20;



We design Bayeslab firstly towards the end user side which has **tabular data**,  need to get results quickly that **doesn't fit in excel**, and without hard-core data team **always ready** for disposal.

#### **Tabular data**

Bayeslab works best with tabular data. It can be exported from any business system or by email, or can be from any database/data lake.&#x20;

Currently we don't plan to support processing of raw data that requires hand-tweaked deep learning models or videos.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bayeslab can process non-structured data like image/pdf/pure text using OCR + Generative-AI, into data table for analysis later. See [here](connect-to-data/working-with-files.md).
{% endhint %}

#### **Beyond Excel**

Excel has many good ways such as flexible cells/pivot table/format/formulas.  It's the most popular "data analysis" tool and will continues to be so in quite some time.

While we all know it's limitations:

* Limited Data Size
  * Bayeslab can handle hundreds of millions of rows, GB level data with ease.
* Cross join with other data source
  * Bayeslab unifies different data source under single SQL and unified schema.
* Professional Charts
  * Bayeslab provides professional [data charts](analyze-visualize/chart.md), customizable.
* Advanced Modeling
  * Bayeslab provides [machine learning](analyze-visualize/machine-learning.md) so simple, you just need to say a few words
* Formular/VBA
  * Bayeslab uses natural language to describe logic, while still editable for finer detail
* AI Help
  * Strangely Excel has not come with a good copilot for now.&#x20;
  * Bayeslab provide specific copilot for[ every step of analysis flow](analyze-visualize/your-analysis-flow.md).

When excel has done it's first couple of operations and more serious analysis is required, Bayeslab is what you need.

#### Self-Sufficient

To analyze data efficiently and with correct result, often we need quite a lot of skills, or helps from others that have that skill.&#x20;

The skills include but not limit to:

* Programming
  * Python
  * SQL
* Statistics/Math
* Domain knowledge
* Library
  * Plotly/sklearn/numpy/scipy/pandas....etc

With Bayeslab, you can complete analysis **without** any , some even **all of the skills** above.  Bayeslab with AI can fill in any skill as necessary , acting as a good intern/analyst/engineer.&#x20;

At the same time you can still use your own skill to produce maximum results, since all underline details are available to you and customizable.



## Design Principles

### **AI-First**

What does it mean to be an AI-first product? Itâ€™s about embracing the strengths of AI to augment human capabilities, not just automate tasks. At Bayeslab, we focus on:

1. **Context Is Everything:** AI hallucinations (or errors) often stem from missing context. By grounding our platform in your real-world data and workflows, we ensure accurate, trustworthy insights.
2. **Autonomy Where It Matters:** Bayeslab acts as an agent, tackling technical details(python/sql/pandas/sklearn/plotlyâ€¦etc) so you can focus on what and why. Think of it as the perfect partner: tireless, thorough, and always scanning for solutions you might have missed.
3. **Empowering 10x Employees:** With Bayeslab, you donâ€™t need a dedicated data team to achieve data-driven success. Itâ€™s about making individuals 10x more efficientâ€”freeing your data engineers to work on data quality and infra, and empowering you to act as your own analyst.

### **Security You Can Trust**

Handling sensitive data comes with responsibility. Bayeslab is built with security as a priority, ensuring your data is safe, private, and handled with care. Whether you're managing customer data or internal reports, you can trust Bayeslab to keep your information secure.

### **Shaping the Future of Data Work**

Weâ€™re in the early days of AI-first products. Just as early graphical user interfaces shaped how we interact with computers, AI-first tools are shaping how we interact with data.&#x20;

Itâ€™s not just about getting the best result in a single taskâ€”itâ€™s about making data analysis accessible, reliable, and intuitive for everyone.

**Welcome to Bayeslabâ€”your AI-first data workbench. Letâ€™s get to work.**
