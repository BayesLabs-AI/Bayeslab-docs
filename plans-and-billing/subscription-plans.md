# Subscription Plans

Bayeslab is subscription based which you'll get refill of a fixed amount of points per month. The time starts at your first payment and resets every month at the same time.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
No matter the subscription is payed per month or year,  point are refilled on a monthly basis starting from your first payment time.
{% endhint %}

At the beginning of each subscription cycle, unused points would be expired and new points are given to your account.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If the subscription start date does not exists in later months,  we'll align to the end of that month for refill.



For example you purchase at Jan 31st, the next refill date would be Feb 28th.
{% endhint %}

## Points

Points are deducted from your account during usage of Bayeslab. Here's a list of activities that would deduct points:

* Use Bayeslab AI to generate&#x20;
* Running any type of code/block
* Use of any paid connectors (like OCR, ChatGPT)

If there's not enough points, no further activities above can be executed.  You can still view/share any data/projects you have.&#x20;



You can then choose to wait until next refill date, or purchase add-on package to temporarily refill your points.

## Add-on Package

This is to temporarily refill a fixed amount of points to your account for use.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
The points refilled by add-on package expire at the SAME TIME of current subscription month.&#x20;



For example you purchase subscription on Jan 1st, then purchase an add on on Jan 15th.  **Both of them would expire at Feb 1st** and only amount of subscription would be refilled.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please **avoid purchasing large add-on package** near the end of your subscription month as it won't be carried over.
{% endhint %}
